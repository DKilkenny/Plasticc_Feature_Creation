# PLAsTiCC Astronomical Object Classification

This notebook is to show how I processed a dataset that would not fit into my computer's memory with Dask and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Dask is a Python library for parallel programming that leverages task scheduling for computational problems. It allowed me to test on my laptop and easily scale to a GCP cluster using Kubernetes. If you have any questions about this project or Dask, feel free to contact me at danny.kilkenny18@gmail.com

# PLAsTiCC Astronomical Object Classification

This notebook is to show how I processed the dataset for Kaggle's PLAsTiCC competition to classify astronomical objects for a new survey telescope which is being installed in Chile. The dataset would not fit into my computer's memory due to it's size (19GB) therefore I turned to Dask and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Dask is a Python library for parallel programming that leverages task scheduling for computational problems. It allowed me to test on my laptop and easily scale to a GCP cluster using Kubernetes. If you have any questions about this project or Dask, feel free to contact me at danny.kilkenny18@gmail.com
